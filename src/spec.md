# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace all contact email addresses shown anywhere in the frontend UI with `SankalpHubsolutions@gmail.com`.

**Planned changes:**
- Search the entire frontend codebase for any email address strings used in UI text (e.g., Contact page, Footer, About section) and replace each occurrence with exactly `SankalpHubsolutions@gmail.com`.
- Ensure only the email text is updated, with no changes to layout, styling, component structure, routes, tools, calculators, or other page content.

**User-visible outcome:** Everywhere the site displays a contact email address, it now shows `SankalpHubsolutions@gmail.com` and no previous email addresses appear in the UI.
