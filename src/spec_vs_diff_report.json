  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented for /emi-calculator: the page H1/title remains \"Free EMI Calculator Online\", an intro paragraph was added via ToolShell description, and SEO utility now sets exact requested title/meta description for /emi-calculator. However, the diff also introduces SEO metadata for additional routes beyond /emi-calculator, which conflicts with the acceptance criterion that no other routes’ titles/descriptions change and with the non-goal of updating SEO content for other pages.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly limits SEO updates to /emi-calculator and states no other routes’ titles/descriptions should change; adding metadata for other routes is outside scope and may change their document titles/descriptions.",
