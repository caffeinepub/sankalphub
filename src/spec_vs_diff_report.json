  "summary": "Diff adds a new FinanceGuidesPage component, introduces a ROUTES.FINANCE_GUIDES constant, appends a Finance Guides nav item, and adds /finance-guides to sitemap.xml. However, the diff summary does not provide enough visible evidence to confirm the requested non-homepage (static-page) SEO behavior is applied for /finance-guides, and it includes changes to ancillary project tracking/summary files not requested.",

      "requirement": "Apply non-homepage SEO behavior for the Finance Guides route consistent with other non-tool static pages (i.e., do not apply tool SEO; do not modify homepage SEO).",
      "reason": "App.tsx is truncated and does not show the actual SEO branching logic for the new /finance-guides route; while SEO utilities are imported, the diff excerpt does not confirm that /finance-guides uses the same default/static-page SEO behavior as other non-tool pages (e.g., About/Contact) and not tool SEO.",
